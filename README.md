The Arduino Universal Button Library is an Arduino library for interacting with any button or buttons.
The buttons may be attached to digital pins, analog pins (like proportional hall effect sensors), or
multiple buttons attached to an analog pin (using different resistors to VCC), or even buttons
attached to I2C or SPI or other buses.

UniversalButton does debouncing and can invoke callback functions for:
* single click events,
* double click events,
* medium press events, and
* long  press events.

There are various methods to support altering the timing of button clicks and presses and exactly
when the callback is invoked during the button press.
